#              The personal initialization file, executed for login shells

#              The individual per-interactive-shell startup file
#       ~/.bash_logout
#              The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits

#              Individual readline initialization file

# You can source your .bashrc from your .bash_profile file 
# and put PATH and common settings in .bashrc so it executes for login and non-login shells.

# An exception to the terminal window guidelines is Mac OS Xâ€™s Terminal.app, 
# which runs a login shell by default for each new terminal window, calling .bash_profile instead of .bashrc

# You can hit the tab key while typing a Git command and it will automatically complete the name of the command for you.
# It also works for branch names, tag names, .git/remotes file names and more.
# First download the auto completion script and rename the file
# cd ~
# curl -OL https://github.com/git/git/raw/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
# mv ~/git-completion.bash ~/.git-completion.bash

if [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then
