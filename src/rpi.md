## Get OS image

You *could* use an imager program that flashes an operating system on the SD card for you but you'll be very limited in the ways you can pre-configure the OS. It's better to download the OS image and flash it yourself.  
   
I recommend using an **Ubuntu** image made specifically for your board instead of a manufaturer's custom OS like Raspberry Pi OS or Orange Pi OS. Those are designed for simplicity and ease of use at the expense of functionality that is important when building a cloud native homelab.

* ‚ùå Raspberry Pi OS doesn't come with [`cloud-init`](https://cloud-init.io).
* ‚ùå Orange Pi OS doesn't support the GPU, Neural Processing Unit (NPU), and Vision Processing Unit (VPU) that some Orange Pi boards have for Artificial Intelligence and graphics-intensive workloads.
* ‚úÖ Ubuntu comes with `cloud-init` preinstalled which will make your life easier.
* ‚úÖ Ubuntu comes with [`snapd`](https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/snaps-intro) preinstalled which lets us pre-configure [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io).
* ‚úÖ Ubuntu, Debian, and Android support the Orange Pi's GPU, NPU, and VPU.

Make sure you grab the image corresponding to your Pi's CPU architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). We'll use the *Server* version because we don't need the graphical environment that comes with the *Desktop* version.  

Official Ubuntu images for all Raspberry Pis (recommended):  
[Download](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)  
[Checksums](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu.com/blob/main/releases.yaml)

Manufacturer's images for Orange Pi 3B:    
[Download](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-Pi-3B.html)  

The rest of this guide assumes you downloaded your image to `~/Downloads`.

Examples of verifying the integrity of the image file:
```sh title="On your laptop" 
# Check the sum from the Ubuntu website and decompress
echo "f3842efb3be1be4243c24203bd16e335f155fdbe104b1ed8c5efc548ea478ab0 *ubuntu-22.04.3-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz" | shasum -a 256 --check
xz -d ubuntu-22.04.3-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz

# Extract Orange Pi image and check the sum
7zz x Orangepi3b_1.0.0_ubuntu_jammy_server_linux5.10.160.7z
shasum -c Orangepi3b_1.0.0_ubuntu_jammy_server_linux5.10.160.img.sha
```

## Option A: Cloud native 
This is the repeatable, flexible option.

!!! tip
    This lets you automatically upgrade the system, configure users, modify boot parameters, install software, run commands on first boot, among other things. Recommended when setting up multiple Pis or installing Kubernetes.

!!! important
    This requires the OS image to:

    * Have `cloud-init` preinstalled.
    * Be mountable on the OS you're using (e.g. macOS) so you can inject `user-data` and boot parameters.
    
    ‚úÖ Supported by the Ubuntu images for Raspberry Pi.  
    ‚ùå Not supoprted by Orange Pi images.

    If you're setting up an Orange Pi, download the image and see the [one-off](#option-b-one-off) instructions.

We'll flash a pre-configured SD card with:  

* Hostname
* A user with ssh key authentication (and password authentication disabled)
* Upgraded packages
* Additional packages installed
* Kubernetes (MicroK8s) installed with some addons enabled
* Wi-Fi configuration
* Boot parameters modified to support Kubernetes

If you don't have an ssh key, [generate one](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen) with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`.  

!!! tip
    Install `pv` to see a progress bar and percentage of completion as the image is being flashed:  
    `brew install pv`

!!! attention
    This example uses macOS. Adjust the commands with your OS's tools to [copy/paste](https://ostechnix.com/how-to-use-pbcopy-and-pbpaste-commands-on-linux/), view disks, `dd` options, and [`sed` version](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/13711/differences-between-sed-on-mac-osx-and-other-standard-sed). It has been tested with the image provided by Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi.  

### Flash the image

Insert the SD card and check the device name e.g. `/dev/disk4`
```sh title="On your laptop" 
diskutil list
```

Use that device name to flash the OS image to the SD card.
```sh title="On your laptop" 
###################################################################
# REPLACE WITH YOUR VALUES
###################################################################
IMAGE='ubuntu-22.04.3-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img' 
DEVICE='/dev/disk4' 
###################################################################

# Unmount the card
diskutil unmountDisk $DEVICE

cd ~/Downloads
# sudo dd if=$IMAGE of=$DEVICE bs=1m status=progress
pv $IMAGE | sudo dd bs=1m of=$DEVICE
```

When it's done you'll see a volume mounted on your desktop called `system-boot` or something similar. Modify the volume to inject `user-data` and set boot parameters needed by Kubernetes.
```sh title="On your laptop" 
###################################################################
# REPLACE WITH YOUR VALUES
###################################################################
VOLUME='system-boot'

HOSTNAME='raspberrypi4b' 
LOCALE='en_US' 
TIMEZONE='US/Central'

You can verify that the files were written correctly
```sh title="On your laptop" 
cat /Volumes/$VOLUME/user-data
cat /Volumes/$VOLUME/cmdline.txt
```

Unmount the SD card
```sh title="On your laptop"
diskutil unmountDisk $DEVICE
```

üéâ **You're done!** üçæ  

Now remove the SD card from your laptop and insert it into the Pi which **should be connected to your router with an ethernet cable**. The Wi-Fi won't be available until everything has finished configuring and you manually do a required system restart.

Since we pre-configured everything it has a lot of work to do on the first boot and it takes several minutes. You'll be able to go in as soon as the SSH service is up but it will probably still be in the process of upgrading packages as well as installing and configuring our software.  

Go make yourself a cup of tea before [connecting](#access-your-pi) for the first time.

Once enough time has passed, you can now check a few things to make sure everything went smoothly.
```zsh title="On your Pi"
# Check if there were any `cloud-init` errors
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init.log | grep failures
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

# Check if packages were installed
sudo apt list | grep avahi-daemon
sudo apt list | grep lshw
sudo cat /var/log/apt/history.log

# Check if a service is running
systemctl status 'avahi*'

# Check if MicroK8s is intalled and running with the addons enabled
sudo microk8s status --wait-ready

# Check cloud-init's network configuration 
cat /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg

# Look at the network configuration.
# You may need to `sudo reboot` for Wi-Fi to be enabled but 
# make sure you've allowed enough time for cloud-init to 
# finish configuring your instance!
sudo lshw -c network
ip addr show | grep wlan0
```

## Option B: One-off 

!!! tip
    This is the easiest option but is limited in how much you can pre-configure the OS. Recommended if you're setting up only one board or if your OS image doesn't have `cloud-init`.


### Flash the image

Use Raspberry Pi Imager or Balena Etcher (`brew install --cask [raspberry-pi-imager | balenaetcher]`) to flash the image to the SD card. If you use Pi Imager you can:  

* Change the password for the default user or disable passwords altogether.  
* Enable SSH (password or ssh keys); remove password authentication if using keys.  
* Configure Wi-Fi if needed.  
* Set the hostname.  

!!! attention
    The Orange Pi images have to be configured manually after first boot.

[Access your Pi](#access-your-pi) 

### Upgrade

* `upgrade` is used to install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system. New packages will be installed if required to satisfy dependencies, but existing packages will never be removed. If an upgrade for a package requires the removal of an installed package the upgrade for this package isn't performed.  
* `full-upgrade` performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the system as a whole.

```zsh
pi@raspberrypi4:~ $ sudo apt update # updates the package list
pi@raspberrypi4:~ $ sudo apt full-upgrade
```

### Configure

Make the board reachable using its hostname, not only its IP. Also install tool to view hardware info.
```zsh
sudo apt install avahi-daemon lshw
```

#### Authentication

If you **didn't do so during setup**, generate and add an ssh key.
```zsh title="On your laptop"
# Specify the type of key to create e.g. `ed25519` or `rsa`.
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
# Add it on the remote machine (if the `-i` filename does not end in `.pub` this is added)
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa pi@raspberrypi4b.local
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 orangepi@orangepi3b.local
```

To remove password authentication:
```zsh title="on the Pi"
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
and replace `#PasswordAuthentication yes` with `PasswordAuthentication no`.
Test the validity of the config file and restart the service (or reboot).
```zsh title="on the Pi"
sudo sshd -t
sudo service sshd restart
sudo service sshd status
```

#### Board-specific tools

##### Raspberry Pi

On Raspberry Pi OS
```zsh
pi@raspberrypi4:~ $ sudo raspi-config
# Go to Interface Options, VNC (for graphical remote access)
# Tab to the Finish option and reboot.
```

##### Orange Pi

In Ubuntu for Orange Pi, to reach other machines by hostname you need to add an entry to the hosts file even if `avahi-daemon` is running on the hosts. Example:
```zsh title="/etc/hosts"
192.168.x.x  thathostname.local
```

Orange Pi has a config tool as well
```zsh
orangepi@orangepi3b:~$ sudo orangepi-config
```
If you just need to connect to Wi-Fi on Orange Pi, use:
```zsh
nmcli dev wifi connect wifi_name password wifi_passwd
```

To set a static IP on Orange Pi see the [user manual](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-Pi-3B.html) for instructions on using the `nmtui` command.

#### Other
After this, [install MicroK8s](/reference/k8s/#microk8s).

## Usage

### Access your Pi

!!! tip

    **Before connecting to your Pi**  
    If it's not already running, start the `ssh-agent` in the background and add your private key to it so you're not asked for your passphrase every time.
    ```zsh title="On your laptop"
    # is it running?
    ps -ax | grep ssh-agent
    # which identities have been added?
    ssh-add -l

    # start the agent and add your identity
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

If you're **reinstalling** the OS you might need to remove old key fingerprints belonging to that hostname from your `known_hosts` file. Example:
```zsh title="On your laptop"
ssh-keygen  -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts -R raspberrypi4b.local
```

If your board is already running `avahi-daemon` you can reach it using its hostname.
```zsh title="On your laptop"
arp raspberrypi4b.local 
```
Otherwise, find your board's IP in your router's admin UI or by going over the list of all devices on your network with `arp -a`.

SSH into it with the configured user e.g. `pi` and the IP address or hostname. Examples:
```zsh title="On your laptop"
ssh pi@raspberrypi4b.local
# or
ssh pi@192.168.xxx.xxx
```

Update the password for default users like `pi`, `orangepi`, `ubuntu`, etc. Examples:
```zsh
sudo passwd root
sudo passwd pi
```

### Remote GUI access
*If you installed a graphical desktop*

You'll need a VNC viewer on your laptop to connect to the Pi using the graphical interface.
```zsh title="On your laptop"
brew install --cask vnc-viewer
```

!!! attention
    Apparently, on Raspberry Pi OS `pip` does not download from the Python Package Index (PyPI), it downloads from PiWheels. PiWheels wheels do not come with `pygame`'s dependencies that are bundled in normal releases.

    Install Pygame [dependencies](https://www.piwheels.org/project/pygame/) and Pygame.
    ```zsh title="On your Pi"
    sudo apt install libvorbisenc2 libwayland-server0 libxi6 libfluidsynth2 libgbm1 libxkbcommon0 libopus0 libwayland-cursor0 libsndfile1 libwayland-client0 libportmidi0 libvorbis0a libopusfile0 libmpg123-0 libflac8 libxcursor1 libxinerama1 libasyncns0 libxrandr2 libdrm2 libpulse0 libxfixes3 libvorbisfile3 libmodplug1 libxrender1 libsdl2-2.0-0 libxxf86vm1 libwayland-egl1 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libjack0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libinstpatch-1.0-2 libxss1 libogg0
    sudo pip3 install pygame

    # Check that the installation worked by running one of its demos
    python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
    ```

### To give it a static IP
Find the IP adddress of your router. It's the address that appears after `default via`.
```zsh
pi@raspberrypi4:~ $ ip r
default via [IP]
```
Get the IP of your DNS server (it may or may not be your router)
```zsh
pi@raspberrypi4:~ $ grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
```

Open this file:
```zsh
nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```
and add/edit these lines at the end filling in the correct info.
```
interface [wlan0 for Wi-Fi or eth0 for Ethernet]
static_routers=[ROUTER IP]
static domain_name_servers=[DNS IP]
[static or inform] ip_address=[STATIC IP ADDRESS YOU WANT]/24
```
`inform` means that the Pi will attempt to get the IP address you requested, but if it's not available, it will choose another. If you use `static`, it will have no IP v4 address at all if the requested one is in use.  

Save the file and `sudo reboot`. From now on, upon each boot, the Pi will attempt to obtain the static ip address you requested.  

You could also set your router to manually assign the static IP to the Pi under its DHCP settings e.g. LAN, DHCP server.

### To set it up as a DNS server
0. Install and configure a DNS Server e.g. DNSmasq or Pi-Hole on the Pi.
1. Change your router‚Äôs DNS settings to point to the Pi. Log in to your router's admin interface and look for DNS e.g. in LAN, DHCP Server. Set the primary DNS server to the IP of your Pi and make sure it's the only DNS server. The Pi will handle upstream DNS services.


### Copying files

To copy files between the Pi and local machine
```zsh title="On your laptop"
scp -r pi@raspberrypi2.local:/home/pi/Documents/ ~/Documents/pidocs
```

### Find info about your Pi

What model do you have?
```zsh
cat /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/model ;echo
```

What's the connection speed of the ethernet port?
```zsh
ethtool eth0
```

32 or 64-bit kernel?
```zsh
getconf LONG_BIT
# or check machine's hardware name: armv7l is 32-bit and aarch64 is 64-bit
pi@raspberrypi4:~ $ uname -m
```

See OS version
```zsh
cat /etc/os-release
```

Architecture    
If the following returns a `Tag_ABI_VFP_args` tag of `VFP registers`, it's an `armhf` (`arm`) system.  
A blank output means `armel` (`arm/v6`).
```zsh
pi@raspberrypi2:~ $ readelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep Tag_ABI_VFP_args
```
Or check the architecture with:
```zsh
hostnamectl
```

You can find info about the hardware like ports, pins, RAM, SoC, connectivity, etc. with:
```zsh
pi@raspberrypi4:~ $ pinout
```

### Troubleshooting

If your Pi's ethernet port is capable of 1Gbps, you're using a cat5e cable or better, your router and switch support 1Gbps,  and you're still only getting 100Mbps **first try with another cable**. A faulty cable is the most common cause of problems like this. If that doesn't work you can try disabling EEE (Energy Efficient Ethernet) although it will be reenabled at reboot. You could also try setting the speed manually.
```zsh
ethtool --show-eee eth0
sudo ethtool --set-eee eth0 eee off

# set speed manually and disable autonegotiation
ethtool -s eth0 speed 1000 duplex full autoneg off
```

If not using `cloud-init` or an imager program, enable ssh with
```zsh
touch /Volumes/$VOLUME/ssh
```

DNS issues
```zsh
cat /etc/resolv.conf
resolvectl status
```
