# Package manager 
## macOS
Get [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager for macOS.
```zsh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew doctor
```
You can use a more [detailed guide](https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/index.html) if needed.
## Linux
Depending on your distribution, you may have apt (Ubuntu), yum (Red Hat), or zypper (openSUSE).
